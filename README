nsproxy
====================

nsproxy is a Linux-specific command-line tool, makes any application force to
use a specific socks5 proxy.

Functionally similar to tsocks / proxychains-ng / graftcp, but using a
completely different mechanism. It has the following features:

 - Works on static linked application.
 - Supported UDP protocol.
 - No privilege required.


USAGE
----------

nsproxy [-s <server>] [-p <port>] [-d <dns>] [command]

examples:

 $ nsproxy curl https://api.ipify.org
 $ nsproxy -s 127.0.0.1 -p 1080 -d 8.8.8.8 nslookup google.com


KNOWN ISSUE
----------

All {uid,gid} except the current user will be mapped to
/proc/sys/kernel/overflow{uid,gid}

That's means file owners except the current user will be shown as 'nobody',
and program like sudo / su will not work.

W.I.P
----------

 - IPv6 support
 - HTTP proxy server support
 - fullcone NAT
 - fake DNS
